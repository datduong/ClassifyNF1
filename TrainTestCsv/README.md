## Csv specifying which images are in which fold during the 5 fold-cv. 

There are 5 folds for training, indexing start at `fold=0` to `fold=4`. Please note, we do not need test.csv. The test images are coded as `fold=5` in the train.csv. 

Please note: 
  - `Crop` is our own name for _focused images_. 
  - `Recrop` is our own name for _panoramic images_. 
  
## Download our NF1 dataset. 

After you download our NF1 dataset and the corresponding `train.csv`, put both the images and the .csv in the same folder name `Crop` (for the _focused images_) and folder name `Recrop` (for the _panoramic images_); for example: `/data/duongdb/DeployOnline/ClassifyNF1/Example/Crop`.
